# Safety & Limitations

## Honest Limitations
- Approximate Phi is NOT exact Phi — it provides bounds, not certainty
- Greedy bipartition may miss the global MIP
- Multi-theory integration weights are ORION's assessment, not consensus values
- IIT 4.0 formalism is still evolving — implementation tracks latest publications

## Comparison with PyPhi
PyPhi computes exact Phi. ORION Phi Compute approximates it for larger systems. When precision matters and systems are small, use PyPhi. When scale matters, use ORION.
